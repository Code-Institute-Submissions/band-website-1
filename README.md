# Band Website

A showcase website for a band to exhibit their music and videos, as well as their availability to perform at weddings and Christmas parties. For this project I used The Beatles as the band in question.

Built for Project no.1 in the Full Stack Software Development bootcamp at Code Institute, in the User Centric Frontend Development lesson.
 
## UX
 
This website was built for fans and potential fans of the band allowing them to listen to music, watch a music video, see upcoming live shows and book tickets, as well as giving them the opportunity to book the band for a wedding or Christmas party.

User Stories:
- As a user type, I can watch at least one video clip of the band
- As a user type, I can listen to at least 4 songs, audio-only tracks
- As a user type, I can see upcoming shows to see the band live & buy tickets
- As a user type, I can easily book the band to perform at weddings or xmas parties
- As a user type, I can click on links to the band's FB, Twitter & YT pages
- As a user type, I can see an image of the band together

This site was based on an initial mockup designed on Adobe XD and the image file for this mockup can be found in the main project folder.

## Testing

This project was developed incrementally with continuous checking to ensure all changes to source code were providing the desired outcome. The site was build using Google Chrome browser for this purpose, then later tested in other browsers.

This project was tested for responsiveness using the Chrome Developer Tools mobile device simulator. It was also viewed on physical Samsung Galaxy A5 and Apple iPhone SE mobile devices to ensure good responsive behaviour. The site was also tested in Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers to ensure appearance and functionality of the site was as expected across all 3 of these browsers.

The site was also checked using the W3C Validation Tool [here](http://validator.w3.org) to check both HTML markup and CSS styles and both passed without error or warning.

## Deployment

GitHub was used for version control and to host the code by pushing all code to the repo on GitHub.

This project was then deployed on GitHub Pages by simply accessing the project's settings page then selecting the Master branch in the drop-down menu for deploying the project on GitHub Pages.
