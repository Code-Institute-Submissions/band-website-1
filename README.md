# Band Website

A showcase website for a band to exhibit their music and videos, as well as their availability to perform at weddings and Christmas parties. For this project I used The Beatles as the band in question.

Built for Project no.1 in the Full Stack Software Development bootcamp at Code Institute, in the User Centric Frontend Development lesson.
 
## UX
 
This website was built for fans and potential fans of the band allowing them to listen to music, watch a music video, see upcoming live shows and book tickets, as well as giving them the opportunity to book the band for a wedding or Christmas party.

User Stories:
